**This project used beautiful soup to scrape an entire website**

## PROBLE, 
I and my family always had to rely on Netflix-recommended movies, which really weren't that great. My little brother suggested that it would be really cool if we knew the titles of the best movies of all time. I found this website which had all the best movies listed, but I didnt want to visit it anytime we wanted to watch a movie.

## SOLUTION 
I decided to use my python scraping skills to scrape the entire website for all the movies listed there and saved it locally in a CSV file and don't have to visit the website anytime we wanna watch a top movie of all time.
